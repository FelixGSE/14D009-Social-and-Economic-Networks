These graphs contain only 47 nodes, but they are almost fully connected and many have nodes with strong self-loops. We apply two measures: random walk centrality and one based on count-betweenness. Our findings are intuitive. For example, in Luxembourg the most central sector is “Finance and Insurance” and the analog in Germany is “Wholesale and Retail Trade” or “Motor Vehicles”, according to the measure. Rankings of sectoral centrality vary by country. Some sectors are often highly central, while others never are. Hierarchical clustering reveals geographical proximity and similar development status.},

	Abstract                 = {Input-output tables describe the flows of goods and services between the sectors of an economy. These tables can be interpreted as weighted directed networks. At the usual level of aggregation, they contain nodes with strong self-loops and are almost completely connected. We derive two measures of node centrality that are well suited for such networks. Both are based on random walks and have interpretations as the propagation of supply shocks through the economy. Random walk centrality reveals the vertices most immediately affected by a shock. Counting betweenness identifies the nodes where a shock lingers longest. The two measures differ in how they treat self-loops. We apply both to data from a wide set of countries and uncover salient characteristics of the structures of these national economies. We further validate our indices by clustering according to sectors&rsquo; centralities. This analysis reveals geographical proximity and similar developmental status.}

@article{Bogachev2007,
	abstract = {Random walks provide a simple conventional model to describe various transport processes, for example propagation of heat or diffusion of matter through a medium. However, in many practical cases the medium is highly irregular due to defects, impurities, fluctuations etc., and it is natural to model this as random environment. In the random walks context, such models are referred to as Random Walks in Random Environments (RWRE). This is a relatively new chapter in applied probability and physics of disordered systems, initiated in the 1970s. Early interest was motivated by some problems in biology, crystallography and metal physics, but later applications have spread through numerous areas. After 30 years of extensive work, RWRE remain a very active area of research, which has already led to many surprising discoveries. The goal of this article is to give a brief introduction to the beautiful area of RWRE. The principal model to be discussed is a random walk with nearest-neighbor jumps in independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random environment in one dimension, although we shall also comment on some extensions and generalizations. The focus is on rigorous results; however, heuristics is used freely to motivate the ideas and explain the approaches and proofs. In a few cases, sketches of the proofs have been included, which should help the reader to appreciate the flavor of results and methods.},

@article{Newman2005,
abstract = {Betweenness is a measure of the centrality of a node in a network, and is normally calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between node pairs that pass through the node of interest. Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Mavroforakis2016,
abstract = {We study a new notion of graph centrality based on absorbing random walks. Given a graph {\$}G=(V,E){\$} and a set of query nodes {\$}Q\backslashsubseteq V{\$}, we aim to identify the {\$}k{\$} most central nodes in {\$}G{\$} with respect to {\$}Q{\$}. Specifically, we consider central nodes to be absorbing for random walks that start at the query nodes {\$}Q{\$}. The goal is to find the set of {\$}k{\$} central nodes that minimizes the expected length of a random walk until absorption. The proposed measure, which we call {\$}k{\$} absorbing random-walk centrality, favors diverse sets, as it is beneficial to place the {\$}k{\$} absorbing nodes in different parts of the graph so as to "intercept" random walks that start from different query nodes.   Although similar problem definitions have been considered in the literature, e.g., in information-retrieval settings where the goal is to diversify web-search results, in this paper we study the problem formally and prove some of its properties. We show that the problem is NP-hard, while the objective function is monotone and supermodular, implying that a greedy algorithm provides solutions with an approximation guarantee. On the other hand, the greedy algorithm involves expensive matrix operations that make it prohibitive to employ on large datasets. To confront this challenge, we develop more efficient algorithms based on spectral clustering and on personalized PageRank.},

The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a large social network dataset with 8 million users and almost 1 billion links, in which the prominent users are labeled. We show that we can efficiently identify a large portion of the prominent individuals in the network using our algorithm, outperforming standard web-inspired methods such as HITS and PageRank.},
